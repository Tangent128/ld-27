* an escape-the-room-style puzzle game, where each puzzle involves an elaborate set of actions to escape combining a variety of objects in the room. Time loops every ten seconds, so you have to use trial-and-error / rapid exploration

- Sleep motif, 10 seconds on clock until you lose and wake up

- Human protag
* As such “run and jump” style gameplay
* Move via LUDR arrows
* Attack with Space
** So linear attack direction
** Gun is easiest attack to animate. May be more apropos to use physical attack (e.x. with pillow)
** Charge and basic attacks? 
* Pause / Quit with Escape
* Allow crouching / shielding?
* Health tied to time? Or independent and HP / wound scaled?
** e.x. If struck by enemy, does a "D" drop from "RADD" or does X seconds drop from the clock?

- Gain more time by:
* Clearing rooms
** Sidescrolling and tile-based
* Defeating “alarm clock” enemies

- Level Design Notes:

* Rooms randomly generated
* Get more difficult as more time on clock
* Random % are "boss rooms"
** Bosses should be designed to be clearable as long as you prioritize sniping "alarm clocks"
* Should have height component
* Environmental hazards:
** Spikes
** Pits
*** How to handle respawning? Or is game over?
** Pushing one way or another (e.x. fans)
** Rising/Falling blocks
* Puzzles?
* Ladders where cannot attack and vulnerable?
* Switches to change environment variables? e.x. Friction, gravity?
* "Warp Tiles"?

* What invariants must the procgen seed obey?
** How to ensure rooms not unwinnable?

- Enemy Types:

* Things should play off of sleep-based themes. Either by being surreal, related to sleep, or both. Not fully sure what that looks like for these, but here are the mechanical descriptions
* HP measured in wounds / hits?

Normal (Pick around 6 of the following, make giant / palette-swapped as needed):

* "Crawler" - Don't get touched 
* "Shooter"/"Fireballs" - Don't get hit by fireballs
* "Swooper"/"Annoying flying thing to dodge" - Don't get touched, less readily counterable / avoidable patterns.
* "Alarm Clock"/"Treasure Chest Monster" - Adds +10 seconds
* "Tank"/"Break defenses then defeat" - Defenses broken by sustained or charged attacks? Snipe afterwards
* "AOE Enemy" - Don't get caught in attack range
* "Environmental Hazard Maker" - Scatters spikes or like
* "Interface Screw" - Changes order of LURD arrows and direction.

Boss: 

* How much HP to give?
* Are scaled up versions of normal enemies? Or unique?

* "Armored Shooter" - Break through defenses to land hits, regenerates armor. Sends projectiles at player.
* "Hazard Swooper" - Swoops at player. Drops environmental hazards to make dodging harder.
* "AOE Crawler" - Rushes at player, attempts to catch up in a ranged attack (e.g. Earthquake)
