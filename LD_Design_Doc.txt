* an escape-the-room-style puzzle game, where each puzzle involves an elaborate set of actions to escape combining a variety of objects in the room. Time loops every ten seconds, so you have to use trial-and-error / rapid exploration

- Sleep motif, 10 seconds on clock until you lose and wake up

- Human protag
* As such “run and jump” style gameplay
* Move via LUDR arrows
* Attack with Space
** Gun is easiest attack to animate. May be more apropos to use physical attack (e.x. with pillow)
* Pause / Quit with Escape

- Gain more time by:
* Clearing rooms
* Defeating “alarm clock” enemies

- Rooms randomly generated
* Get more difficult as more time on clock
* Random % are "boss rooms"
** Bosses should be designed to be clearable as long as you prioritize sniping "alarm clocks"
